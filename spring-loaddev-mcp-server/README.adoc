== Overview

An MCP server for Spring Load Development project.

== Configuring Copilot Connection

To connect GitHub Copilot to this server, you need to configure the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project directory.

=== Configuration Steps

1. Create an `mcp.json` file inside the `.vscode` folder
2. Add the following configuration:

[source,json]
----
{
    "servers": {
        "reloading-mcp-server": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "http://localhost:8080/sse",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

TIP: Make sure the port number matches your local MCP server configuration.

== Authentication

The MCP server requires bearer token authentication for secure access. For detailed instructions on authentication and obtaining tokens, please refer to the link:../spring-loaddev-api-gateway/src/test/http/README.adoc[API Gateway Testing Guide].

TIP: The authentication process uses Keycloak and is the same as described in the API Gateway documentation.
