Spring Load Development is a project that demonstrates the integration of various modern technologies and frameworks to build a robust microservices architecture. This project showcases the use of Spring Boot for microservices, Spring WebFlux for reactive RESTful web services, Spring Data R2DBC for reactive database connectivity, Spring Cloud Config for externalized configuration management, Spring Cloud Gateway for API gateway, and Resilience4J for circuit breaker patterns.

[NOTE]
====
*Load development* is used here as an example business domain to demonstrate microservices architecture and modern cloud-native patterns. In the context of competitive shooting, load development refers to the process of systematically testing and refining ammunition components (such as powder charge, bullet, primer, and case dimensions) to achieve optimal accuracy and performance for a specific firearm. This project manages and analyzes load development data as a sample use case, but the architecture and patterns are applicable to many other domains.

====

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

* Java 21 or later
* Docker and Docker Compose
* Maven 3.8+

=== Running Locally

==== Clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/zhoozhoo/spring-load-development.git
cd spring-load-development
----

==== Start the infrastructure services using Docker Compose:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose --env-file .env up -d
----

=== Accessing Services

* Config Server: http://localhost:8888
* Discovery Server: http://localhost:8761
* API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
* Keycloak Admin Console: http://localhost:7080
* Jaeger UI: http://localhost:16686

=== API Documentation

API endpoints are documented using OpenAPI (Swagger). Once services are running, access the documentation at:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Alternatively, use the `.http` files in `spring-loaddev-api-gateway/src/test/http/` with the VS Code REST Client extension for manual testing.

=== Services Architecture

The application is composed of the following services:

* *Config Server*: Centralized configuration management for all services
* *Discovery Server*: Service registry and discovery using Eureka
* *API Gateway*: Routes and filters requests to appropriate services
* *Rifles Service*: Manages rifle data and configurations
* *Loads Service*: Handles load development data including groups and shots
* *Admin Server*: Monitoring and management of all services

=== Configuration Repository

The centralized configuration for all services is stored in a separate GitHub repository:
https://github.com/zhoozhoo/spring-load-development-config

The Config Server automatically picks up configuration files from this repository at startup.

=== Security

The application uses Keycloak for identity and access management with the following features:

* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* JWT token-based authentication
* OAuth2/OpenID Connect integration
* Predefined roles: RELOADER
* Fine-grained permissions for loads and rifles management

=== Monitoring and Observability

The project includes Spring Boot Admin Server for monitoring and managing your Spring Boot applications:

* Access the Admin Server dashboard at http://localhost:9090
* Monitor application health, metrics, and environment
* View detailed information about each service
* Access actuator endpoints through a user-friendly interface
* Track service status and configurations
