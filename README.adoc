Spring Load Development is a project that demonstrates the integration of various modern technologies and frameworks to build a robust microservices architecture. This project showcases the use of Spring Boot for microservices, Spring WebFlux for reactive RESTful web services, Spring Data R2DBC for reactive database connectivity, Spring Cloud Config for externalized configuration management, Spring Cloud Gateway for API gateway, and Resilience4J for circuit breaker patterns.
