= REST API Testing Guide

== Overview

This directory contains comprehensive testing resources for the Spring Load Development API services. It includes:

* HTTP request files for testing API endpoints using VS Code's REST Client extension
* A shell script for automated test data loading
* Configuration files for environment variables

The test files cover authentication and full CRUD operations for all API services including rifles, loads, groups, shots, and components (cases, powders, primers, bullets).

=== Data shapes used in requests

All quantity-like values use JSR-385 (Units of Measurement) with a consistent JSON shape:

* Quantity: {"value": number, "unit": string, "scale": "ABSOLUTE" | "RELATIVE"}
    - Examples:
        - Bullet weight: {"value": 140, "unit": "[gr]", "scale": "ABSOLUTE"}
        - Range: {"value": 100, "unit": "[yd_i]", "scale": "ABSOLUTE"}
        - Velocity: {"value": 2800, "unit": "[ft_i]/s", "scale": "ABSOLUTE"}
    * HTTP request files for testing API endpoints using VS Code's REST Client extension
    * A shell script for automated test data loading
    * Configuration files for environment variables
    * Full-text search examples for component resources (cases, propellants, primers, projectiles)
* MonetaryAmount: {"amount": number, "currency": "ISO-4217 code"}
    - Example: {"amount": 89.99, "currency": "CAD"}
    The test files cover authentication and full CRUD operations for all API services including rifles, loads, groups, shots, and components (cases, propellants, primers, projectiles), plus search endpoints.

Notes:
* The scale field is optional and defaults to ABSOLUTE when omitted.
* Units use UCUM formatting (e.g., "[in_i]", "mm", "m/s").
* Dimensionless quantities (counts) must use the UCUM symbol "1" rather than descriptive words like "one". Example: {"value": 100, "unit": "1"}
* For mass in imperial units, use UCUM avoirdupois symbols: pounds "[lb_av]", ounces "[oz_av]", grains "[gr]".

== Prerequisites

    * Authentication with Keycloak
    * CRUD operations for cases, propellants, primers, and projectiles
        - Cases: create, get, update, delete, search (`/api/cases/search?query=...`)
        - Propellants: create, get, update, delete, search (`/api/propellants/search?query=...`)
        - Primers: create, get, update, delete, search (`/api/primers/search?query=...`)
        - Projectiles: create, get, update, delete, search (`/api/projectiles/search?query=...`)

* Bash shell (Linux/macOS/WSL)
* `curl` command-line tool
    * Creates a load development dataset with multiple powder charges (using [gr])

    NOTE: Load validation requires at least one of `distanceFromLands` or `caseOverallLength` to be provided. The script sets both along with `neckTension`.
=== Required Running Services

* PostgreSQL database (default: localhost:5432)
    * Run `load_test_data.sh` to quickly populate the system with test data (includes required distanceFromLands and caseOverallLength for loads)
    * Check the script output for any errors or issues during data loading
    * Use the new search endpoints to validate full-text indexing, e.g. `GET /api/cases/search?query=Lapua`
* Discovery server (default: localhost:8761)
* API Gateway service (default: localhost:8080)
* Rifles service (default: localhost:8081)
* Loads service (default: localhost:8082)
* Components service

== Configuration

The environment configuration is stored in `http-client.env.json`. It includes:

* Keycloak authorization server settings
* Client credentials
* Test user credentials

== Available Test Files

=== HTTP Request Files

==== rifles-service.http

Contains requests for testing the Rifles API endpoints:

* Authentication with Keycloak
* CRUD operations for rifles

==== loads-service.http

Containing requests for testing Loads, Groups, and Shots API endpoints:

* Authentication with Keycloak
* Loads: CRUD operations for loads, load statistics
* Groups: CRUD operations for groups, group statistics
* Shots: CRUD operations for shots
* All tests use JSR-385 Quantity types with proper units (imperial and metric)
* Workflow-based organization: Loads → Groups → Shots

==== components-service.http

Contains requests for testing the Components API endpoints:

* Authentication with Keycloak
* CRUD operations for cases, powders, primers, and bullets
  - Cases: create, get, update, delete
  - Powders: create, get, update, delete
  - Primers: create, get, update, delete
  - Bullets: create, get, update, delete

=== Configuration Files

==== http-client.env.json

Environment configuration file containing:

* Keycloak authorization server settings
* Client credentials
* Test user credentials

=== Automated Data Loading

==== load_test_data.sh

A bash script that automatically loads test data into the system via REST API calls using the JSON shapes above. This script:

* Authenticates with Keycloak to obtain access tokens
* Creates a test rifle (Tikka T3x CTR)
* Creates a load development dataset with multiple powder charges (using [gr])
* Creates shooting groups with group size ([in_i]), range ([yd_i]), and velocities ([ft_i]/s)
* Provides comprehensive error handling and colored output
* Validates that all required services are running before execution

To run the script:

[source,bash]
----
cd spring-load-development/test
chmod +x load_test_data.sh
./load_test_data.sh
----

The script requires the same configuration as the HTTP files and will use the `http-client.env.json` file for authentication settings.

== How to Use

=== Using HTTP Request Files

1. Open any `.http` file in VS Code
2. You'll see clickable `Send Request` links above each request
3. Select the environment from the bottom status bar (default: "local")
4. Click `Send Request` to execute

TIP: Requests that require authentication will automatically use the token from the "Authenticate" request.

=== Using the Automated Data Loader

1. Ensure all required services are running
2. Navigate to the test directory: `cd spring-load-development/test`
3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x load_test_data.sh`
4. Run the script: `./load_test_data.sh`

The script will:

* Verify all dependencies are available
* Load configuration from `http-client.env.json`
* Check that services are accessible
* Authenticate with Keycloak
* Create test data including rifles, loads, groups, and shots
* Provide a summary of created entities

== Request Flow

1. First, run the "Authenticate" request to get an access token
2. The token is automatically used in subsequent requests
3. Test individual endpoints as needed

== VS Code Settings Configuration

To make the environment variables available globally in VS Code:

1. Open VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings or `Ctrl+,`)
2. Click on the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in the top-right corner
3. Add the following configuration:

[source,json]
----
{
    "rest-client.environmentVariables": {
        "$shared": {
            // Shared variables across all environments
        },
        "local": {
            "authorization_host": "http://localhost:7080",
            "realm": "reloading",
            "client_id": "reloading-client",
            "client_secret": "2EvQuluZfxaaRms8V4NhzBDWzVCSXtty",
            "username": "reloader1",
            "password": "reloader1"
        }
    }
}
----

TIP: This allows you to use these variables in any `.http` file across your workspace.

== Tips

=== HTTP Request Testing

* Use the response of one request in another with the syntax `{{RequestName.response.body.field}}`
* Headers can be modified directly in the `.http` files
* Add new environments by creating new objects in `http-client.env.json`
* You can chain requests using dynamic variables (e.g., use IDs from previous responses in subsequent requests)
* The `.http` files are updated as new endpoints or changes are introduced in the API

=== Automated Testing

* Run `load_test_data.sh` to quickly populate the system with test data
* The script validates services are running before attempting to load data
* Check the script output for any errors or issues during data loading
* Use the created test data IDs in your HTTP request files for further testing

=== Troubleshooting

* Ensure all services are running before testing
* Verify Keycloak is properly configured with the reloading realm
* Check that the client credentials in `http-client.env.json` are correct
* If authentication fails, verify the user `reloader1` exists in Keycloak
