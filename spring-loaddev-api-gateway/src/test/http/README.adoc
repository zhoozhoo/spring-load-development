== Overview

This directory contains HTTP request files for testing the Spring Load Development API services using VS Code's REST Client extension. The test files cover authentication and full CRUD operations for rifles, loads, groups, and shots APIs.

== Prerequisites

* Visual Studio Code installed
* REST Client extension installed (`humao.rest-client`)
* Running instances of:
** PostgreSQL database (default: localhost:5432)
** Keycloak server (default: localhost:7080)
** Config server (default: localhost:8888)
** Discovery server (default: localhost:8761)
** API Gateway service (default: localhost:8080)
** Rifles service (default: localhost:8081)
** Loads service (default: localhost:8082)

== Configuration

The environment configuration is stored in `http-client.env.json`. It includes:

* Keycloak authorization server settings
* Client credentials
* Test user credentials

== Available Test Files

=== rifles-service.http

Contains requests for testing the Rifles API endpoints:

* Authentication with Keycloak
* CRUD operations for rifles

=== loads-service.http

Contains requests for testing the Loads API endpoints:

* Authentication with Keycloak
* CRUD operations for loads, groups, and shots

=== groups-service.http

Contains requests for testing the Groups API endpoints:

* Authentication with Keycloak
* CRUD operations for groups
* Group statistics

=== shots-service.http

Contains requests for testing the Shots API endpoints:

* Authentication with Keycloak
* CRUD operations for shots

== How to Use

1. Open any `.http` file in VS Code
2. You'll see clickable `Send Request` links above each request
3. Select the environment from the bottom status bar (default: "local")
4. Click `Send Request` to execute

TIP: Requests that require authentication will automatically use the token from the "Authenticate" request.

== Request Flow

1. First, run the "Authenticate" request to get an access token
2. The token is automatically used in subsequent requests
3. Test individual endpoints as needed

== VS Code Settings Configuration

To make the environment variables available globally in VS Code:

1. Open VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings or `Ctrl+,`)
2. Click on the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in the top-right corner
3. Add the following configuration:

[source,json]
----
{
    "rest-client.environmentVariables": {
        "$shared": {
            // Shared variables across all environments
        },
        "local": {
            "authorization_host": "http://localhost:7080",
            "realm": "reloading",
            "client_id": "reloading-client",
            "client_secret": "2EvQuluZfxaaRms8V4NhzBDWzVCSXtty",
            "username": "reloader1",
            "password": "reloader1"
        }
    }
}
----

TIP: This allows you to use these variables in any `.http` file across your workspace.

== Tips

* Use the response of one request in another with the syntax `{{RequestName.response.body.field}}`
* Headers can be modified directly in the `.http` files
* Add new environments by creating new objects in `http-client.env.json`
* You can chain requests using dynamic variables (e.g., use IDs from previous responses in subsequent requests)
* The `.http` files are updated as new endpoints or changes are introduced in the API
